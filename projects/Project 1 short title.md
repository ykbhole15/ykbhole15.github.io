## 🚀 Executive Summary / TL;DR

[Write 2-4 sentences summarizing the core problem, your approach, and the key result or insight. This is the elevator pitch.]

---

## 🎯 Problem Definition & Goal

[Clearly state the objective. What business problem or question were you addressing? Why is it important? e.g., "The goal was to identify factors contributing to customer churn and build a predictive model to flag at-risk customers for proactive retention efforts."]

---

## 📊 Data

*   **Source:** [Where did the data come from? e.g., "Kaggle Telecom Churn Dataset", "Simulated data based on...", "Anonymized company data". Add a link if public.]
*   **Description:** [What did the data contain? Key features? Number of rows/columns? e.g., "Customer demographics, account information (tenure, contract), services subscribed to, monthly charges, and churn status."]
*   **Preprocessing:** [Briefly mention key steps. e.g., "Handled missing values using median imputation, encoded categorical features using One-Hot Encoding, scaled numerical features using StandardScaler."]

---

## 🛠️ Methodology & Tools

*   **Approach:** [Explain your strategy. e.g., "Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations with churn. Compared three classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting."]
*   **Techniques:** [List specific algorithms/methods. e.g., "Logistic Regression", "Feature Importance analysis (from Random Forest)", "Cross-Validation", "Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)".]
*   **Technology Stack:** [List libraries/software. e.g., `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Jupyter Notebook`.]

---

## 📈 Results & Analysis

[Present your findings. What did the EDA show? How did the models perform? Focus on insights.]

*   **Key Findings:** [e.g., "EDA revealed higher churn rates for customers with month-to-month contracts and fiber optic service.", "The Gradient Boosting model achieved the highest AUC ROC score of 0.85 on the test set."]
*   **Model Performance:** [Include specific metrics. e.g., "Precision: 0.XX, Recall: 0.YY, F1-Score: 0.ZZ. Discuss the trade-offs if relevant."]
*   **Visualizations:** *(See Step 6 & 7 below)*
